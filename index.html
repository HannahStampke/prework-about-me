      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am bubbly and fervently driven. Marketing coordinator by day, creative fiend by night. A nine year old once described me as a person who has a phobia of not laughing: that hit a little too close to home.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am an Adelaidean who lives too close to wine country.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Writing, diving, caving, mentally escaping.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One where I can stay in marketing but design for web and dabble in the creative arts.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>A farmhouse on a hillside, overlooking the quaint little town of Clarendon</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I feel that marketing and web developing go hand-in-hand. I want to be a workplace unicorn that can see solutions from multiple aspects.</p>
